# About Me

I am a seasoned Software Engineer with 25+ years of experience, specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation processes. My adaptability enables me to work proficiently in various programming languages and tackle numerous challenges throughout my career.

## Expertise & Skills

I actively work with languages and technologies such as `C#`, `Python`, `PowerShell`, `GraphQL`, `TypeScript`, `NextJS`, and `PostgreSQL`, using `Visual Studio Code` for code editing and database management. My extensive professional experience has equipped me with the skills to automate tasks and develop innovative tools.

### Artificial Intelligence

My passion for AI drives me to explore its potential and applications in various domains. I am dedicated to developing intelligent systems that learn and adapt independently, making them valuable assets in an ever-changing technological landscape.

#### Projects

My AI journey involves working on projects, learning the latest techniques in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and developing proprietary SaaS applications that leverage AI for innovation and efficiency across industries.

One notable project is [Agent-LLM](https://github.com/Josh-XT/Agent-LLM), a versatile Python application utilizing AI language models for task management and problem-solving. It supports various AI providers, including OpenAI GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Oobabooga Text Generation Web UI, llama.cpp, and more, with the list continually expanding.

#### Technologies

To stay current with AI developments, I work with ML and DL frameworks, libraries, tools, and models, including:
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- OpenAI GPT-3/GPT-4
- LLaMa (and the many derived models such as Vicuna, Alpaca, etc)
- OpenAssistant
- Many more, new ones are coming out daily that I am exploring.

### Quantum Computing

My fascination with quantum mechanics, ignited by Stephen Hawking's book **The Theory of Everything**, led me to learn quantum computing and create my [Quantum repository](https://github.com/Josh-XT/Quantum) to share my experiences and insights.

To advance my knowledge, I participated in the [2023 MIT iQuHACK Quantum Computing Hackathon](https://www.iquise.mit.edu/iQuHACK/2023-01-27) and plan to engage in similar events in the future. This journey has expanded my technical expertise and opened up new possibilities for innovation and collaboration.

## Philosophy

I firmly believe in automating manual tasks that are performed more than twice. This principle has guided me in creating various scripts, applications, and websites throughout my career, such as my [repository of scripts for automating PC and server setup processes](https://github.com/Josh-XT/Setup), showcasing my dedication to efficiency and effectiveness.
