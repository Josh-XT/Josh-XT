## About Me

I am a Software Engineer with a lot of emphasis on creating and implementing automation processes for systems management and API integrations.  I use ``Visual Studio Code`` for all code editing and database management.  In my typical day, I actively work in ``C#``, ``Python``, ``PowerShell``, ``GraphQL``, ``TypeScript``, ``NextJS``, and ``PostgreSQL``.

The majority of my life has been about software development. I've been building software, web applications, and scripts for over 25 years now and have worked in more programming languages and frameworks than I can remember at this point. I've worked professionally in almost every area of IT which has enabled me to automate away a lot of time consuming IT management tasks and build many useful tools.  Even after all of these years, the passion has never gone away and neither has my pursuit of knowledge in the field.

## My Philosophy

If I have to do the same manual task more than twice, it should be automated.  Living by this has resulted in many scripts, applications, and websites being created over the past 25+ years, including the scripts below for automating my own PC setup process.

## Quantum Computing

After reading Stephen Hawking's book "The Theory of Everything", my interest in Quantum Mechanics and the accompanying concepts took the top seat in what I ~~wanted~~ needed to know more about. I started down the road of learning how to write code for Quantum Computers from there and started a new repository called [Quantum](https://github.com/Josh-XT/Quantum) to share my experiences.
